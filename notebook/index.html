# Web Notebooks

> Self-hosted, executable and extensible web pages.

Web notebooks are simple, self-hosted Markdown documents, with code blocks that
are executed entirely in the browser -- no "backend" needed. In fact, this page
is such a notebook! Look at the source code (`Ctrl+U` in Chrome) to learn more.

The entire page is written in Markdown, with a single script tag and a
`&lt;body&gt;` on the first line.

The runtime supports a few types of code blocks out of the bock, like
[JavaScript](#code-blocks), [HTML](#html-blocks) and [CSS](#css-blocks).

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are assumed to be JavaScript, unless they have a more specific
language tag. JavaScript code blocks can be executed; other code blocks are
currently only that: code blocks.

Here is an example:

```js
new Date();
```

The entire block is evaluated as one expression, and the result is printed out
below the block when executing. To print more than one value, use the
`console.log()` function as usual:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

## HTML Blocks

HTML can be included just like any other code snipped, using the `html`
language tag. Note, however, that the browser will execute the HTML before it
gets added to the body! Once Markdown parsing happens, the HTML will be removed
and replaced by code blocks.

When an HTML "code block" is executed, its contents get appended right below
the code block. Like in this example:


```html
<span>This is a some textâ€¦</span>
<script>
  // But beware of inline script tags!
  console.log("This will be eagerly executed by the browser!");
</script>
```

## CSS Blocks

CSS code blocks are a bit special, in that they have no output, but instead
modify the stylesheet of the entire page. They can of course target any HTML
content added in other blocks too:

```html
<span class="example-red">This text should turn red.</span>
```

```css
.example-red {
  color: red;
}
```

More types of code blocks, as well as some utility functions will be added
soon, so stay tuned!

## Config Blocks


The `meta` block or `notebook-config` block is used to configure the notebook
itself. Only the first such blcok is parsed, and its contents must be a JSON
object encoding a TypeScript `NotebookConfig` object. Here is an example that
turns on auto-run for code blocks on this page:

```meta
{
  "autorun": true
}
```

The config is also available at runtime, on the `Notebook` object's `config`
property:

```js
notebook.config
```
