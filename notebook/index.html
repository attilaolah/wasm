# WebAssembly Notebooks

WebAssembly notebooks are a simple yet powerful tool to demonstrate code
snippets on the web. In fact, this page is such a notebook! Look at the source
code (`Ctrl+U` in Chrome) to learn more.

Currently notebooks support a small set of features:

- [JavaScript code blocks](#code-blocks)
- [HTML code blocks](#html-code-blocks)
- [CSS code blocks](#css-code-blocks)

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are assumed to be JavaScript, unless they have a more specific
language tag. JavaScript code blocks can be executed; other code blocks are
currently only that: code blocks.

Here is an example:

```
const answer = 42;
console.log(answer);
```

## HTML Code Blocks

HTML can be included just like any other code snipped, using the `html`
language tag. Note, however, that the browser will execute the HTML before it
gets added to the body! Once Markdown parsing happens, the HTML will be removed
and replaced by code blocks.

When an HTML "code block" is executed, its contents get appended right below
the code block. Like in this example:


```html
<span>This is a some textâ€¦</span>
<script>
  // But beware of inline script tags!
  console.log("This will be eagerly executed by the browser!");
</script>
```

## CSS Code Blocks

CSS code blocks are a bit special, in that they have no output, but instead
modify the stylesheet of the entire page. They can of course target any HTML
content added in other blocks too:

```html
<span class="example-red">This text should turn red.</span>
```

```css
.example-red {
  color: red;
}
```

More types of code blocks, as well as some utility functions will be added
soon, so stay tuned!
